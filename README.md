# Firebase-in-Contact-form
In this project I have created a simple form using HTML and CSS and then connected it with Firebase for Database. For fonts I have used Google Fonts and for Icons I have used Font Awesome.

The first file is of simple form without any backend with css of only simple form.

The next file is of form with backend on Firebase and main.js and updated css.

In Firebase Database choose Realtime DB and then private one and make the Write Rule to be "true" in order for permission access.
