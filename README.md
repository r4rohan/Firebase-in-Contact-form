# Firebase-in-Contact-form
In this project I have created a simple form using HTML and CSS and then connected it with Firebase for Database. For fonts I have used Google Fonts and for Icons I have used Font Awesome.

Html file is just a simple form with only basic html and css and backend is on Firebase.

In Firebase Database choose Realtime DB and then private one and make the Write Rule to be "true" in order for permission access.
